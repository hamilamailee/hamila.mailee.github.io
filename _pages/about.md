I'm Hamila, an unserious person following my dreams seriously üôÇ

I'm currently a second year PhD student at the University of Manchester, supervised by <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/terence.morley">Dr. Terence Morley</a>, and have had the honor of working with brilliant researchers like <a href="https://rafaelkuffner.github.io/">Dr. Rafael Kuffner dos Anjos</a>, <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/zahra.montazeri">Dr. Zahra Montazeri</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~gudukbay/">Prof. Uƒüur G√ºd√ºkbay</a> as project supervisors.
My project revolves around animating facial expressions in cartoon faces. Moreover, I'm insterested in learning more about Classical Computer Animation techniques‚Äîespecially traditional 2D and cel animation‚Äîand integrating them into current modern approaches.

Before my current studies, I received my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology, with a Thesis titled **Creating BVH File From DeepLabCut Output for
Animating Animals‚Äô Motion** supervised by <a href="https://sina.shari f.edu/~jamzad/">Prof. Mansour Jamzad</a>. The project focused on extracting motion from animated animal characters and converting it to the commonly used BVH format for animation. This approach enables motion capture to map movements from one animated character to another with ease. Alongside my studies, I also explored various industries, working as a data scientist and game developer, all of which brought me to my starting point: <a style="color:red;">G</a><a style="color:orange;">R</a><a style="color:yellow;">A</a><a style="color:green;">P</a><a style="color:blue">H</a><a style="color:indigo;">I</a><a style="color:purple;">C</a><a style="color:pink;">S</a>

In my spare time, I enjoy reading Webtoons, learning languages (currently improving my Turkish and Japanese), DIYs, playing games + music, watching Cartoons/Anime, and walking. I can be dragged out of my comfort zone with one cup of coffee and enjoy extensively talking about it. Drop me a message on any platform, and I'll respond ‚òï

I'm Hamila, an unserious person following my dreams seriously ðŸ™‚ 

I'm currently a second year PhD student at the University of Manchester, supervised by <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/terence.morley">Dr. Terence Morley</a>, and have had the honor of working with brilliant researchers like <a href="https://rafaelkuffner.github.io/">Dr. Rafael Kuffner dos Anjos</a>, <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/zahra.montazeri">Dr. Zahra Montazeri</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~gudukbay/">Prof. UÄŸur GÃ¼dÃ¼kbay</a> as project supervisors. 
My project revolves around animating facial expressions in cartoon faces. Moreover, I'm insterested in learning more about Classical Computer Animation techniquesâ€”especially traditional 2D and cel animationâ€”and integrating them into current modern approaches.

Before my current studies, I received my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology while working in different industries as a data scientist and game developer, all to return to the point I started: <a style="color:red;">G</a><a style="color:orange;">R</a><a style="color:yellow;">A</a><a style="color:green;">P</a><a style="color:blue">H</a><a style="color:indigo;">I</a><a style="color:purple;">C</a><a style="color:pink;">S</a> ðŸŽ‰

In my spare time, I enjoy reading Webtoons, learning languages (currently improving my Turkish and Japanese), DIYs, playing games + music, watching Cartoons/Anime, and walking. I can be dragged out of my comfort zone with one cup of coffee and enjoy extensively talking about it. Drop me a message on any platform, and I'll respond â˜•
